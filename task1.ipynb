    "# TASK 1 - Find the prime numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a positive integer and a list of prime numbers, the objective is to find two prime numbers from the list that sum up to the given positive number. To accomplish this task, it's essential to consider the appropriate number of qubits and explain the validity of the proposal for all types of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to approach this problem. One method involves systematically adding up various combinations of prime numbers from the list until the desired sum is achieved. To execute this approach, we would require three quantum registers: two to store the prime numbers being added together, and a third to store the final result. A quantum modulo addition operation can be employed to add the numbers in the first two registers. Subsequently, we measure the third register and perform a classical check to verify if it matches the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach has a drawback. Reinitializing the first two registers for each modulo addition operation incurs a time cost due to the classical-to-quantum overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, an alternative approach is to create a classical list of all possible combinations of prime numbers whose summation equals the given positive integer. Afterward, Grover's algorithm is utilized to verify whether the prime numbers required are present in this list. The number of qubits required will depend on the size of this list, which is determined by the number of primes you're considering."
